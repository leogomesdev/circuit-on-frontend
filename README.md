# 🌐 CIRCUIT ON (Frontend)

See application structure on the image below:

![System tiers](docs/images/others/tiers.png)

This is the Frontend application. This project depends on APIs provided by the Backend application.
For Backend application, please go to [https://github.com/leogomesdev/circuit-on-backend](https://github.com/leogomesdev/circuit-on-backend)

## 📚 Description

CIRCUIT ON allows you to manage images for displaying on TV based on a schedule. This is super useful for Gyms that need to display different images simultaneously on multiple TVs.

The idea for this app is to save time: it would not be required to manually switch the pictures on different TVs. Instead, use this app to upload the images and set a schedule. On the TV, open the view page on the native Internet Browser. The image on the view page will be automatically replaced by the next images at the specified date and time.

## 📲 Main technologies used

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1
- [OKTA](https://developer.okta.com) for Authentication
- [Commitizen command line tool](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
- [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
